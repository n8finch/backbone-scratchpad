# Backbone Book Library App

This is a sample app from the [Backbone Applications book](https://addyosmani.com/backbone-fundamentals/#exercise-2-book-library---your-first-restful-backbone.js-app)

This work is not mine originally. I might add some bells and whistles, but it is just for the purpose of learning Backbone. I've copied here for my reference. 

Original tutorial can be found at the above link.
